# AI Agents

This repository showcases different projects demonstrating how AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged for various use cases. Each project explores a specific application of AI, from document analysis and data processing to automated mockup generation.

## Projects

### 1. Process File with AI
*Created: August 2024*

**Purpose**: Run the same prompt consistently on different input files (text, PDF).

Enables repeatable AI analysis of documents using reusable instruction templates with configurable Azure OpenAI settings.

### 2. Prompt My Data with AI
*Created: August 2024*

**Purpose**: Process data files locally using natural language without sending data to the LLM.

Translates natural language queries into Python scripts for local data analysis. Only file structure (first 10 lines) is sent to the LLM, ensuring confidentiality and handling large datasets efficiently.

### 3. Mockup Factory
*Created: June 2025*

**Purpose**: Generate professional HTML mockups for laboratory information technology applications using AI assistance.

Provides a structured multi-step workflow with prompt templates to guide AI in creating use cases, detailed mockup descriptions, and working HTML prototypes using Bootstrap 5. The progressive approach leverages AI domain knowledge during use case definition and ensures mockup descriptions are finalized before HTML generation, preventing misaligned implementations.

### 4. Microservice Development Pipeline
*Created: January 2026*

**Purpose**: Transform business needs into production-ready backend microservices using an AI-driven activity pipeline.

Guides AI through use case definition, decomposition into microservices, independent service development (requirements, contracts, tests, implementation), and integration testing. Features human review gates at critical decision points and full traceability with change history — suitable for regulated industries.
