# AI Agents

Automating the use of LLMs for different activities related to the development of medical software.

## Projects

### 1. Process File with AI
*Created: August 2024*

**Purpose**: Run the same prompt consistently on different input files (text, PDF).

Enables repeatable AI analysis of documents using reusable instruction templates with configurable Azure OpenAI settings.

### 2. Prompt My Data with AI
*Created: August 2024*

**Purpose**: Process data files locally using natural language without sending data to the LLM.

Translates natural language queries into Python scripts for local data analysis. Only file structure (first 10 lines) is sent to the LLM, ensuring confidentiality and handling large datasets efficiently.

### 3. Mockup Factory
*Created: June 2025*

**Purpose**: Generate professional HTML mockups for laboratory information technology applications using AI assistance.

Provides a structured multi-step workflow with prompt templates to guide AI in creating use cases, detailed mockup descriptions, and working HTML prototypes using Bootstrap 5. The progressive approach leverages AI domain knowledge during use case definition and ensures mockup descriptions are finalized before HTML generation, preventing misaligned implementations.
