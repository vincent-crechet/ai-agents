<Be specific enough for activity 00 to classify impact, but stay at the business/product level — no implementation details.>

## GUIDELINES FOR WRITING DESIGN CHANGES

### DO:
- Describe the WHAT and WHY, not the HOW
- Be specific about the desired outcome or behavior
- Mention affected user journeys if relevant
- Include context about the problem being solved (for bug fixes / requirement changes)

### DO NOT:
- Prescribe technical solutions (that's the Architect's job)
- Reference specific code, files, or implementation details
- Mix multiple unrelated changes in one file — create separate files instead

### NOTES:
- The `type` field is a hint — activity 00 will confirm or reclassify
- The `services` field is optional — the impact analysis will determine actual scope
- File naming convention: `<number>-<kebab-case-title>.txt` (e.g., `02-add-observability.txt`)
