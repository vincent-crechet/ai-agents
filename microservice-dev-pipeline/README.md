# AI-Driven Microservice Development Pipeline

An activity-based pipeline that transforms business needs into working backend microservices using AI agents (Claude). This repository contains the **pipeline definition** — YAML activity files, templates, and technical documentation that orchestrate AI-driven development.

## What This Is

A reusable framework (not an implemented application) that guides AI through:
1. **Use case definition** — Product definition and user-observable behavior
2. **Service decomposition** — Breaking use cases into microservices with clear boundaries
3. **Independent microservice development** — Requirements, contracts, tests, and implementation per service
4. **Integration testing** — Docker Compose orchestration with real service harnesses

Point an AI agent at a business need, and it executes the pipeline to generate a complete microservice application.

## Why This Approach

**Token-efficient:** Decomposes work into discrete activities — each reading 3-5 files instead of an entire codebase.

**Human review gates:** AI proposes, human approves at critical points (use cases, service boundaries, requirements, tests).

**Traceable evolution:** Every change flows through impact analysis and produces versioned briefs with change history — audit trails for regulated industries.

## The Pipeline

```
design-changes/                        ← Business need entry point
       │
  01  Business Analysis                ← Use cases, product definition
       │
  02  Service Decomposition            ← Microservice boundaries, workflows
       │
       ├─────────────┬─────────────┐
  03a Requirements   ║   03b Contracts   ← Per-service specs + Python ABCs
       └─────────────┴─────────────┘
                     │
  04  Use Case Tests                   ← Tests with mock harnesses
       │
  05  Service Implementation           ← Independent development per service
       │
  06  Integration Tests                ← Docker Compose, real services
```

Impact analysis (activity 00) determines which activities run for each change type.

## Quick Start

1. Create `design-changes/01-url-shortener.txt`:
   ```
   URL shortener service: shorten URLs, retrieve originals, track statistics
   ```

2. Run in Claude Code: `process design-changes/01-url-shortener.txt`

3. Review at gates: use cases → service boundaries → requirements → tests

4. Get output: `product/`, `architecture/`, `services/`, `use_case_tests/`

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Python 3.11+, Docker

## Architecture

Generated microservices follow hexagonal architecture with repository patterns, Python ABCs for contracts, test doubles for isolation, and Docker containerization.

## Documentation

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — Running activities
- **[.ai/README.md](.ai/README.md)** — Complete specification
- **sample-app** — URL shortener application fully generated by ai activities from sample-app/design-changes/01-url-shortener.txt with review of specification artefact from devlopper.
