# Prompt My Data with AI

## Overview

`prompt_my_data_with_ai.py` is a Python script that allows users to perform data analysis on local data files using natural language.

## Features

The script supports the following activities:
- **Compute Statistics**: You can request average, distribution, maximum, minimum values, etc.
- **Get Insights about Statistics**: You can ask for insights about the computed statistics. To do so, start your prompt with "What do you think".

## How It Works

`prompt_my_data_with_ai.py` leverages AzureOpenAI with GPT-4 for natural language processing. Only the first ten lines of the data file are sent to GPT-4 to provide context. The actual statistical computations are performed locally using Python scripts generated by GPT-4o.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. **OpenAI API**: Install the OpenAI API library using the command:
   ```bash
   py -m pip install openai
   ```
3. **Pandas**: Install the Pandas library using the command:
   ```bash
   py -m pip install pandas
   ```
4. **Configure Python Executable**: Open `prompt_my_data_with_ai.py` and replace the variable `python_executable` with the path to your Python runtime.
5. **Environment Variable**: Set the environment variable `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` with the API key provided separately.
6. **Configuration File**: The Azure endpoint, API version, and model are read from a `config.json` file in the same directory by default. Example `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "azure_endpoint": "https://becopenaidev3.openai.azure.com/",
       "api_version": "2024-10-21",
       "model": "gpt-4o"
   }
   ```

## How to Run the Script

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   py prompt_my_data_with_ai.py [--config <config.json>]
   ```
2. Enter the name of the data file
3. Enter a question about the data

**Options:**
- `--config`: Path to the config.json file containing Azure endpoint, API version, and model (optional, defaults to config.json)

## Example 1

Using data file `titanic_passengers_899_entries.csv`

**Example of questions to display statistics:**
- Who is the youngest passenger to have survived? Who is the youngest passenger to have died?

**Example of questions to get insights about statistics:**
- What do you think about the percentage of surviving passengers for each passenger class?

## Example 2

Using data file `time_logs_200_entries.csv`

**Example of questions to display statistics:**
- Which tester has contributed the most to the project? How his or her time is distributed among the different task types expressed in percentage?

**Example of questions to get insights about statistics:**
- What do you think about the percentage time distribution between the different Feature Type?
