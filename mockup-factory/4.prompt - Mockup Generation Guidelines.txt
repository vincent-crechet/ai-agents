These are guidelines the to generate mockup in HTML

1. Base Framework: Use Bootstrap 5.3.2 as the primary CSS framework. only use the available css/components. do not introduce new CSS class
2. Color Palette (Minimalist):
* Avoid excessive use of vibrant colors. Keep the overall aesthetic clean and professional.
* Reserve colors primarily for functional elements:
  * Labels, badges, and alerts: Use Bootstrap's "bg-primary", "bg-success", "bg-warning", "bg-danger", "bg-info", "bg-secondary" as appropriate for their semantic meaning (e.g., green for success, red for critical, blue for primary actions).
  * Progress bars: Use "bg-info" (or other semantically appropriate Bootstrap colors).
  * Comparison statements: A subtle color (like "text-success" or "text-warning"/"text-danger") for percentage changes (e.g., "5% vs last period") is acceptable.
* Default text colors: Use neutral shades (e.g., "text-dark", "text-secondary", "text-muted") for most body text, card titles, and general UI elements.
* Backgrounds: Keep page and card backgrounds light and neutral (e.g., "bg-light", "bg-white").
3.  Navigation Bar Content:
* Left Side (Beckman Coulter Logo): use "https://media.beckmancoulter.com/-/media/diagnostics/corporate/logos/beckman-logo-svg.svg?rev=a82dc0186fca49bbab9ea6c0f4baba4c&amp;hash=BB8B15F1028FBE9F66CEF498D1FB06BD" with "height: 28px;"
* Left Side (Product Name): The product-specific title (e.g., "Lab Performance Optimization," "Sample & Result Audit Trail") should be clear, bold, and in a neutral color (e.g., "text-dark").
* Right Side (User Information): Display the user's details using this format:
  * "<span class="fw-bold">User:</span> [User Name]" where [User Name] is a name which works well for US/Europe/Asia
  * "<span class="fw-bold">Role:</span> [User Role]"
  * "<span class="fw-bold">Lab:</span> [Assigned Lab Name]"
  * "<span class="fw-bold">Disciplines:</span> [Disciplines]"
  * The attribute names (User:, Role:, Lab:, Disciplines:) should be bold ("fw-bold"), and the actual values (User Name, User Role, Lab Name) should be in plain text. Use "nav-text" class for the overall color (a subtle dark gray).
4.  Card Styling:
* Subtle Shadows: Use Bootstrap's "shadow-sm" class on cards for a clean, modern depth effect.
* Ensure all cards in a row have the same height, even if their content is different
5. Icons: Reduce the usage of Icons to introduce an attribute value. utilize bold text preferably 
6. Layout & Responsiveness: Ensure the layout is clean, well-spaced, and inherently responsive (which Bootstrap handles well by default).
7. Data Presentation: Use clear, concise text for data values, and make labels easy to understand. For larger numbers, use 'K' as applicable (e.g., 22.5K).
8. for badge, include text inside the badge if the mockup description includes a text.
9. for Charts, chartjs code should be embedded in the html code. embed the canvas chart in a div with a fixed height

Do not do anything at the moment I will provide specific requests after that.
