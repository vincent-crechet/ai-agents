Application Name: Sample Review Management

Persona: Michael Chen

Concept: This screen provides a comprehensive view of a specific patient's sample results, with a primary focus on hematology data. It is designed to guide Michael Chen, the Hematology Lab Technician, through the review process by offering intelligent clinical guidance for discrepancies, such as lipemic interference. The integrated view allows for quick access to relevant chemistry results to confirm pre-analytical issues and provides step-by-step recommendations for resolution, like performing a saline replacement, ensuring accurate and timely reporting.

Navigation bar: Default navigation bar with the Beckman Coulter logo and "Patient Sample Review" on the left side. On the right side, it displays user information: "User: Michael Chen", "Role: Hematology Lab Technician", "Lab: Springfield West", "Disciplines: Hematology".

Main areas:

Patient Demographics: Located at the top left, providing key patient identification details.
Intelligent Clinical Guidance & Recommendations: A prominent area on the top right, offering actionable insights and a link to detailed procedural guidance.
Result View Selector (Pills): Positioned below the patient information, allowing switching between different discipline results.
Sample Details & Results Display: The main central area, showing specific sample information and the detailed analytical results in a tabular format.

Below the message, a clickable link: "View Saline Replacement Guidance."
Popup (triggered by clicking "View Saline Replacement Guidance"):
Title: "Saline Replacement Procedure Guidance"
Body:
Step 1: Confirm Lipemia with Chemistry Results
"Review Patient Robert Miller's Chemistry panel for Cholesterol and Triglycerides. Look for elevated values and potential 'LIH' (Lipemia Index) flags indicating severe lipemia."
Step 2: Perform Saline Replacement (if Lipemia Confirmed)
"1. Centrifuge an aliquot of the original sample.
Carefully remove the lipemic plasma.
Add an equal volume of normal saline (0.9% NaCl) to the packed red cells.
Gently resuspend the cells.
Re-run the prepared sample on the DxH800 instrument.
Manually enter or verify the corrected hematology results."
