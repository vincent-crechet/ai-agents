When discussing about features, capabilities or mockup, it is sometimes useful to define "use cases".
A use case can be used to understand how the different actors in the lab (LIS, instruments, automation lines, staff, harmony product, other systems, ...) interact with each other to realize a particular goal.


A use case should be defined as follow:
* Title: the title of the use case
* Need: which problem are we trying to solve
* Steps: a list of steps. each step includes a single actor. example of steps are provided below
** LIS sends an order an CBC/DIFF on an hematology sample
** Instrument sends HQ to Harmony.
** Lab Technician loads sample on the automation line.
** Hamrony displays the alert message 'XXXXXX'
** Lab Technician logs in Harmony
